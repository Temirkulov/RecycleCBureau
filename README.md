RecycleCBureau or Recycling & Conservation Bureau is a web platform developed as part of a school assignment, designed to support community recycling efforts. It features a robust login system, secured with MD5 encryption, and a comprehensive database of local recycling centers. The application is built using PHP and MySQL, providing a hands-on experience in web application development, data handling, and understanding of secure tokens. While the code organization may not be perfect, it served as a valuable learning experience in various aspects of web development and database management. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcomed as continual learning is a key part of this project's journey.
